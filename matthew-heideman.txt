1. HTML written so that if another dev looks at it they will know the purpose of each element.
2. To add content to a webpage.
3. An attribute is something that gives further definition to the content, it goes inside of the tag in the html.
4. It's the biggest of the header tags.  You "can" use it as many times as you want, but it should only be used once to call attention to that item.

14. Gives a definition of something that may not be able to be viewed.
15. #idName
16. Section is more semantic.
17. To style webpages.
18. You would write the element name and then add curly brackets.  h2 {}
19. Id's are specific to one element while classes can be used on multiple elements.  You might want to use an Id for a a hero image and a class for other smaller images you have on the page.
20. .className
21. .human{}
22. It is used to select elements with a specific parent.  You would use it when you have other elements of the same name in the document that you don't want to affect.
23. .sidebar a{}

36. git push -u origin "branchName"
37. fork the repo
    git clone url
    git checkout -b "branchName"

Stretch:
1. An inline element is going to appear inline and a block element will appear wherever it fits on the page.
2. It is no longer interacting with any other element on the page, it's just kind of hovering above.
3. You could give it a max-width property.
5. Margin, Border, Padding, content.  I don't know what they're, the box model is pretty cool as is.
